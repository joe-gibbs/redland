## Game Alfa: 
---
A treasure exploration game where you explore the world around you follow the clues and find the treasure.  


## Goal Game: 
---
A survival game where the goal is to explore the randomly generated game map and follow a treasure map to find the ultimate treasure and achieve victory. 

If playing with another player, you will race to the treasure location. He who reaches the spoils first, will be one step closer to victory, but will have to make sure they are not stopped from making a boat and taking the treasure home!



## Future To Do's: 
---
- add energy indicator
- Add loading screen
- create menu which starts/ends the game possibly gives options in the future?
- put a max 60 fps threshold on the game
- 3 spots marked in the map give location of the treasure all together. 
    1. structure for treasure tracker
    2. piece of the treasure to track 
    3. Indication of area where treasure is. 
- Create needs for building a base and needing to expand your power while exploring, energy and other measurements may need to be implemented before we add a base. 
- add structures and buildings. 
- add day and night
- add animals 
- make animals agro at night.
- add second player. 

## Storyline Concept Ideas:
- The civilization that died off was today's current? That would mean we could Build shit with magical shit like ... Glue or.. tape unknown to the explorers.
- the civilization that died off is actually magical and left materials we need to make up.
- the civilization that died off has some real life historic merit, Atlantis or Some civilization that actually disappeared.
